Overview of pelicun features
----------------------------

.. admonition:: Coming soon.

   This section is under construction.

.. _fo_saving:

Saving/loading samples
......................

All demand, asset, damage, and loss samples can be either computed from other inputs or directly loaded form previously computed and saved samples.

.. _fo_logging:

Logging support
...............

Pelicun produces detailed log files that can be used to document the execution of an assessment as well as information on the host machine and the execution environment.
These logs can be useful for debugging purposes.
Pelicun emits detailed warnings whenever appropriate, notifying the user of potentially problematic or inconsistent inputs, evaluation settings, or deprecated syntax.

.. _fo_uq:

Uncertainty quantification
..........................

Damage and loss estimation is inherently uncertain and treated as a stochastic problem.
Uncertainty quantification lies at the core of all computations in pelicun.
Pelicun supports a variety of common parametric univariate random variable distributions.
With the help of random variable registries, it also supports multivariate distributions, joined with Gaussian copula.

.. _fo_assessment_types:

Assessment types
................

Pelicun supports scenario-based assessments. That is, losses conditioned on a specific value of an Intensity Measure (IM).

..
   TODO: add links pointing to a glossary/definition index of terms.

.. note::

   Support for time-based assessments is currently in progress.

.. _fo_loss_maps:

Loss maps
^^^^^^^^^

.. _fo_active_dvs:

Active decision variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _fo_consequence_scaling:

Consequence scaling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _fo_loss_aggregation:

Loss aggregation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Also talk about replacement thresholds here.

.. _fo_cli:

Command-line support
....................

Pelicun can be ran from the command line.
Installing the package enables the ``pelicun`` entry point, which points to ``tools/DL_calculation.py``.
``DL_calculation.py`` is a script that conducts a performance evaluation using command-line inputs.
Some of those inputs are paths to required input files, including a JSON file that provides most evaluation options.

..
   TODO: point to an example, and index the example in the by-feature grouping.

.. _fo_autopop:

Input file auto-population
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
It is possible for the JSON input file to be auto-populated (extended to include more entries) using either default or user-defined auto-population scripts.

..
   TODO: Why is this useful? Why would a user want to do this?

Standalone tools
................

.. _fo_convert_units:

Unit conversion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _fo_fit:

Fit distribution to sample or percentiles
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _fo_rvs:

Random variable classes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
