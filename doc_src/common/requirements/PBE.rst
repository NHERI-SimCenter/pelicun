Requirements
============


The following contains the functional requirements for the |app|. These requirements are broken down into a number of groups, **general**, and **DL**.

The purpose of presenting these requirements is to inform the community on the present capabilities of the |app| and features that could be added. The original set of requirements have come from a set of grand challenge reports, **GC**. These original requirements have been broken into a smaller set of deliverable features by the senior faculty associated with the project, **SP**. Additional requirements have come from users through the User Forum, **UF**. See section :ref:`features` if you have additional features you would like to see.
