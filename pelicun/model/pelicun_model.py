        Converts the parameters of marginal distributions in a model to SI units.

        Parameters
        ----------
        marginal_params: DataFrame
            Each row corresponds to a marginal distribution with Theta
            parameters and TruncateLower, TruncateUpper truncation limits
            identified in separate columns.
        units: Series
            Identifies the input units of each marginal. The index shall be
            identical to the index of the marginal_params argument. The values
            are strings that correspond to the units listed in base.py.
        arg_units: Series
            Identifies the size of a reference entity for the marginal
            parameters. For example, when the parameters refer to a component
            repair cost, the reference size is the component block size the
            repair cost corresponds to. When the parameters refer to a capacity,
            demand, or component quantity, the reference size can be omitted
            and the default value will ensure that the corresponding scaling is
            skipped. This Series provides the units of the reference entities
            for each component. Use '1 EA' if you want to skip such scaling for
            select components but provide arg units for others.

        Returns
        -------
        DataFrame
            Same structure as the input DataFrame but with values scaled to
            represent internal Standard International units.
