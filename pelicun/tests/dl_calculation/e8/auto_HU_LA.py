def auto_populate(aim):
    """
    Populates the DL model for hurricane assessments in Atlantic County, NJ

    Assumptions:
    - Everything relevant to auto-population is provided in the Buiding
    Information Model (AIM).
    - The information expected in the AIM file is described in the parse_GI
    method.

    Parameters
    ----------
    aim: dictionary
        Contains the information that is available about the asset and will be
        used to auto-popualate the damage and loss model.

    Returns
    -------
    GI_ap: dictionary
        Containes the extended BIM data.
    DL_ap: dictionary
        Contains the auto-populated loss model.
