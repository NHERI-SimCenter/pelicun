This file is used to reset all expected test result data.

def reset_all_test_data(restore=True, purge=False):
    """
    Update the expected result pickle files with new results, accepting
    the values obtained by executing the code as correct from now on.

    Warning: This function should never be used if tests are
    failing. Its only purpose is to aid the development of more tests
    and keeping things tidy. If tests are failing, the specific tests
    need to be investigated, and after rectifying the cause, new
    expected test result values should be created at an individual
    basis.

    Note: This function assumes that the interpreter's current
    directory is the package root directory (`pelicun`). The code
    assumes that the test data directory exists.
    Data deletion only involves `.pcl` files that begin with `test_` and
    reside in /pelicun/tests/data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    restore: bool
      Whether to re-generate the test result data
    purge: bool
      Whether to remove the test result data before re-generating the
      new values.

    Raises
    ------

    ValueError
      If the test directory is not found.

    OSError
      If the code is ran from the wrong directory. This code is only
      meant to be executed with the interpreter running in the
      `pelicun` directory. Dangerous things may happen otherwise.
