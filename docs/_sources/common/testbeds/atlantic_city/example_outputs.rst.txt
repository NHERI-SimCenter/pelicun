The estimated wind-only, flood-only, and total losses under the four hurricane
scenarios (:numref:`hurricane_cat`) are shown in :numref:`dl_c2` to :numref:`dl_c5`.

Average expected loss ratios are also computed for individual cities, which are
summarized in :numref:`cl_c2` to :numref:`cl_c5`

   City-wise average expected loss ratios (**Category 5** hurricane).

For the top five cities with most assets in the building inventory, the average
expected wind losses are computed for different built eras. Buildings before 1980s generally
have relatively higher wind loss ratios where 1970s is found to be the worst decade for
Atlantic City, Brigantine, and Galloway. Since 1980, the building performance is improved
where the post-2000 buildings are found to behave much better than buildings in the other groups.
