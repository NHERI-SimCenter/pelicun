	  The following table outlines the features that are currently available in pelicun and the requirements that will drive future development. We present these requirements to inform the community about our plans. We welcome suggestions for useful features that are missing from the list below. Go to Bugs & Feature Requests (:numref:lblBugs) to let us know about additional features you would like to see.

	  The original set of requirements came from grand challenge reports (**GC**). These were broken into smaller sets of deliverable features by senior faculty associated with the project (**SP**). Additional requirements have come from users through the User Forum, (**UF**). See section :ref:`features` if you have additional features you would like to see.

	  The priority column provides information about the relative importance of the features: **M** - mandatory, **D** - desirable, **O** - optional, **P** - possible.
