.. _changes_v2_5_0:

=================================
Version 2.5.0 (December 31, 2020)
=================================

- Extend the uq module to support:
  - More efficient sampling, especially when most of the random variables in the model are either independent or perfectly correlated.
  - More accurate and more efficient fitting of multivariate probability distributions to raw EDP data.
  - Arbitrary marginals (beyond the basic Normal and Lognormal) for joint distributions.
  - Latin Hypercube Sampling
- Introduce external auto-population scripts and provide an example for hurricane assessments.
- Add a script to help users convert HDF files to CSV (HDF_to_CSV.py under tools)
- Use unique and standardized attribute names in the input files
- Migrate to the latest version of Python, numpy, scipy, and pandas (see setup.py for required minimum versions of those tools).
- Bug fixes and minor improvements to support user needs:
  - Add 1.2 scale factor for EDPs controlling non-directional Fragility Groups.
  - Remove dependency on scipy's truncnorm function to avoid long computation times due to a bug in recent scipy versions.
