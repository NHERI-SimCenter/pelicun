Damage and loss library
-----------------------

.. admonition:: Coming soon.

   This section is under construction.

   We need to finalize the following:

   - The terms we use.
   - Instructions on how to access the files via ``PelicunDefault`` (pending transition to using the submodule's files).
   - Agree on whether to include details on the contents in this documentation or in the DLML repo itself.

The NHERI-SimCenter is maintaining a comprehensive Damage and Loss Model Library (DLML) in the form of a GitHub repository.
The DLML consists of published and commonly used fragility curves, as well as loss and consequence functions.
More details can be found in the repository.
All contents of the DLML are included in pelicun.
